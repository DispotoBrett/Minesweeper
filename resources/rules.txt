This version of Minesweeper is similar to 
the version created by Microsoft. A full 
list of the rules can be found here. 

* Flagging:  Right click on an unrevealed
	square in order to flag it. Right 
	click again on a flagged tile to unflag
	it. You cannot reveal a flagged tile.
	Flagging a square signifies that you 
	believe that there is a mine under 
	that square. You are given an unlimited
	number of flags to use or not use. 
	
* Revealing:  Left click on an unrevealed 
	square in order to reveal it. You 
	cannot reveal a flagged square.	If 
	you try to reveal a square that contains 
	a mine, the game is over. A revealed 
	square is a lighter color than an
	unrevealed square. A revealed square 
	will display a number that shows how 
	many mines are vertically, horizontally,
	or diagonally adjacent to that square.
	If there are no adjacent mines, then 
	the surrounding squares will be revealed
	until there is an adjacent mine. 
	
* Winning and Losing:  If you reveal a 
	mine, it will blow up and display a
	game over screen. Congratulations, 
	you just got yourself killed. If you
	reveal every square on the board that
	isn't a mine, then you win and will 
	be presented with a victory screen.
	Congratulations, your prize is living.
	
* Difficulty:  There are three difficulties,
	each with a different number of squares
	and mines. 
    Easy: 9x9 board with 8 mines
    Medium: 12x12 board with 20 mines
    Hard: 16x16 board with 40 mines
	
* Changing Difficulty:  Under the Game 
	Menu, there is a Difficulty Menu. 
	The difficulty selected indicates
	which difficulty will be used upon
	starting a new game, not necessarily
	the difficulty of the current game.

* Restarting:  To restart the game,
	click on Start New Game in the 
	Game Menu. A new game will be
	immediately started using the 
	difficulty selected in the 
	Difficulty Menu.
