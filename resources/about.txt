 Welcome to Minesweeper, a game first created 
 by Microsoft in 1990, and later bundled with
 all versions of Windows between Windows 3.1 
 and Windows 7. This version of the game was 
 created in Java by Brett Dispoto, Patrick
 Silvestre, and Jordan Conragan as a group 
 project for CS 151, Object-Oriented Design,
 at San Jose State University for the Spring
 2019 Semester. A complete list of the rules 
 can be found in the "How To Play" menu item
 under the help menu.
